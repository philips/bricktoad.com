title: About Brick Toad
---

Brick Toad is an amateur Lego designer that grew up on late 80 and early 90 themes like Castle, Blacktron, Blacktron 2, and M-Tron. I recently rediscovered my love for Lego after many decades and I am excited about the new creative tools like [Bricklink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) and [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/).

Philosophically I like kits that have lots of play potential and are small and moduler. When making designs I try to use common elements in simple ways while keeping an eye on price of elements.

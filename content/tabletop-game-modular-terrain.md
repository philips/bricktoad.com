title: Tabletop Game Modular Terrain
---

I like to play tabletop RPGs with my family like [Hero Kids](http://herokidsrpg.blogspot.com/p/hero-kids-overview.html) or DND. Our family also has a love for Lego and I was really interested in discovering the [/r/legodnd subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/legodnd).

So, over a few weeks I learned Bricklink Studio and came up with my first design heavily inspired by some of the ideas below. My main goal in building this up in studio was to be able to order the correct number of parts.

This design has:
- 8 water tiles
- 12 sand/dirt tiles
- 28 grass tiles
- 6 stone tiles
- 3 stone elevation pieces
- Tent, raft, mushrooms, flowers and a tree
- Skeleton, toad, and chicken

**Inspiration**

Using Lego in a tabletop game makes a lot of sense for characters and terrain because of its flexibility. And there have been a number of really inspiring designs I have seen:

- [u/lurker9061](https://www.reddit.com/r/legodnd/comments/z7aiod/modular_tile_system_i_built_for_dnd_contest/)
- [u/sunkintotheswamp82](https://www.reddit.com/r/legodnd/comments/z5syqc/modular_terrain_tiles_baseplates_and_elevation/)
- [u/dfecht](https://www.reddit.com/r/legodnd/comments/yuxyl1/the_party_embarks_a_modular_lego_adventure/)
- [u/kevin\_yuu](https://www.reddit.com/r/legodnd/comments/zbbrkf/dungeons_and_dragons_lego_edition/)

So, looking through these different ideas here are the ideas I have decided to use:

- Use an area of 4x4 studs as the tile size
  - Minifig on a stand fits in that space
  - Even number for easy element use
- Use 2x2 jumper plate in the middle of each 4x4 tile
  - Secure terrain or minifigs but easy to remove
- Use plates as the attachment between tiles
  - Low piece count: only three elements per tile (2x 4x4 plates, and a 2x2 jumper)
  - Low profile: only two plates of height makes it easy to interact with buildings or other set pieces that are built on single plates

My interest in Norse Mythology was recently rekindled by Neil Gaiman's extremely approachable (and funny!) book titled "Norse Mythology" ([Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/a/91498/9780393356182), [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3ImwW12)). And when considering an alternative build of [Lego's Creator 3-in-1 31143 Bird House](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=2kje9Jnd82k&offerid=1182088.31143&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fbirdhouse-31143) my mind was drawn to the mythical monsters from those Norse myths.

I spent a few hours just playing with the parts in Stud.io and familiarizing myself with the inventory. There are quite a number of interesting parts but I found myself wishing there was a bit more variety in the types of clip pieces for the scenes I was making.

After playing with the parts I finally got inspired by the birds and bees theme of the kit and built three scenes from the "Mead of Poetry" story. If you aren't familiar with the story I recommend you checkout the book above but there is a less entertaining overview on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead_of_poetry).

{{< figure src="/mead-of-poetry-2.png" title="The dwarve Galar in front of the vat Bodn where the mead of poetry is held. He is holding a cup of mead and a weapon recently used, tragically, on Kvasir." >}}

{{< figure src="/mead-of-poetry-1.png" title="Suttungr, the giant, leaves the dwarves, Fjalar and Galar, on a reef at high tide to drown as punishment for the death of his father. They eventually cut a deal: their lives for the mead of poetry." >}}

{{< figure src="/mead-of-poetry-3.png" title="Odin transforms into a serpent and escapes from Suttungr into the mountain where the mead of poetry is being held under the guard of Suttungr's daughter GunnlÃ¶d." >}}

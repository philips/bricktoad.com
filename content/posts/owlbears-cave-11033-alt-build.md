Previously I built an [Owlbear](/posts/owlbear) as a full custom MOC. This time I tried to build a similar character and a whole scene using just parts from the new Classic Creative Fantasy Universe ([Lego.com](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/creative-fantasy-universe-11033)). It was quite a challenge but I got inspired by the possibilities of the 90 degree angle of the 10197 part to recreate the lightweight eye setup of my previous MOC.

I will be the first to admit that this Owlbear doesn't look as good as my other MOC. But! I think it looks great given the constraint of the Classic line of sets.

Included in this MOC are also two Tree-like "Ent" creatures and a cave with a hidden door play feature. I made up a story for the whole scene:

> Owlbears and Ents have always been allies. At their most vulnerable, when they have laid a clutch of eggs, a mother Owlbear has called upon the Ents to protect her clutch. The Ent Queen provided not only protection but a hidden incubation cave under a rock cliff to keep the eggs safe.

Star Mail is a fan built theme that imagines a world of competing space parcel delivery companies. It spawned out of a discussion I started in the [R.R. Slugger](https://www.youtube.com/@RRSlugger) "Summer of Slug 2023" discord channel.

This build is called "Rocket Rush Delivery" and is inspired by the classic [897-1 Mobile Rocket Launcher](https://rebrickable.com/sets/897-1/mobile-rocket-launcher/#parts) it is also an alt build of the [10497 Galaxy Explorer](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/galaxy-explorer-10497) and only uses elements from that set.

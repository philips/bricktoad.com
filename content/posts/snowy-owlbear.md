This Snowy Owlbear was a recolor of my earlier [Owlbear MOC](https://bricktoad.com/posts/owlbear/). Not only that but it is my first attempt at selling a MOC as part of a fundraiser for my child's school. I put it in a box complete with printed out versions of the instructions.

To print out the instructions I used the amazing ['Bookbinder JS'](https://momijizukamori.github.io/bookbinder-js/?rotatePage=true&paperSize=LETTER&pageLayout=quarto&cropMarks=true&cutMarks=true&customSigLength=0&flyleafs=0) with the following settings:

- Alternate Page Rotation (AKA Flip on Long Side)
- Paper Size: Letter
- Page Layout: Quatro
- Cut Marks and Crop Marks: True

This gave me a PDF that I could then print duplex on my HL1440 printer. And with a bit of cutting and stapling I had a servicable instruction manual for the build.

One day I will get around to buying a color printer... until then it will add to the challenge for whoever buys the set.

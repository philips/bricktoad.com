Star Mail is a fan built theme that imagines a world of competing space parcel delivery companies. It spawned out of a discussion I started in the [R.R. Slugger](https://www.youtube.com/@RRSlugger) "Summer of Slug 2023" discord channel.

This build is called "Skyhook" and contains a hook on the back that can be lowered to pick up and drop off Star Mail containers. It is a small build but has a fun sturdy look. Also, importantly, when the hook is raised the ship lays flat for play and aerodynamic swooshing.

The design was built only using parts I picked up cheap from Star Wars Minifig collectors who purchased the [75345 501st Clone Troopersâ„¢ Battle Pack](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/501st-clone-troopers-battle-pack-75345) and [40557 Defense of Hoth](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/defence-of-hoth-40557). I was inspired by a Classic Space "Crater Plate" [MOC done by ickebins](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-120769/ickebins/crater-plate-for-galaxy-explorer-10497/#details) on Rebrickable using the parts from 75334 Obi-Wan Kenobi vs. Darth Vader.

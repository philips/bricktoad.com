I like to play tabletop RPGs with my family. And this build is inspired by a sksleton curse of a raft operator from [DnD Adventure Club](https://dndadventureclub.com).

The trick with this build is that I use headlight elements to make it possible for the raft to attach to a stud on the [modular terrain](https://bricktoad.com/tabletop-game-modular-terrain/). Other than that it is a pretty straightforward Lego raft inspired by [1733-1 Shipwrecked Pirate](https://rebrickable.com/sets/1733-1/shipwrecked-pirate) that I had as a kid.

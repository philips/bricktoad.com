I recently picked up [Adorablins by Dice Up Games](https://www.diceupgames.com/adorablins/) and it is an inspiring kids TTRPG. My kid really likes the characters so I set out to try and build a tiny model that would fit inside of the tin with the dice and cards.

- [PDF Instructions](/adorablin-engineer.pdf)
- [Webrick Wishlist](https://www.webrick.com/wp_collection/share/CCVtNDC9fCPQfUrFJ6KBx7e6KlvRDCuh/)

And mission accomplished, it fits!

Well, I need to order some parts that work right but you get the idea.

Let me know what you think and I will build some additional classes.

[Webrick](https://www.webrick.com) is a service you can upload a parts list of Lego-compatible bricks and they will ship you the parts. All the parts are new but not manufactured by Lego aka they are alt-bricks.

At the beginning of April I ordered parts for two of my MOCs from Webrick: [the Minotaur](https://bricktoad.com/posts/minotaur/) and [the Owlbear](https://bricktoad.com/posts/owlbear/). The result of the builds are great, as you can see below, however I did encounter a handful of minor problems.

### The Problems

### Why Alt-bricks?

Most people choose alternative bricks because they are usually a bit more inexpensive and/or they have unique color options. Personally I appreciate a wider range of colors! However, I am not terribly price sensitive with my Lego hobby.


### Why Webrick?

I find the ordering experience on Bricklink horrendous. The need to shop at multiple stores to complete a build, the expensive shipping, and the inconsistent pricing immediately zaps all

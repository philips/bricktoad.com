This post was inspired by a thread about the new Classic Creative Fantasy Universe ([Lego.com](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/creative-fantasy-universe-11033))and the number of swords it contains (12). Obviously, after taking a look at the set inventory, I needed to build a throne out of swords.

The set has a number of clips but few options to go "off system" with the clips. So, I did what I could within the contraints of the kit to make something that had soem character and looked menacing. And, of course, there is a side table with some wine.
